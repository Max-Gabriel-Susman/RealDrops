# Drops

## Description

Drops is an application where users may create and share areas with oneanother, each area encapsulates the data needed to render and perform work on a collection of pins, these pins are map markers that open windows of information when tapped. An area is intended to allow users to capture sets of geolocations for the purposes of storing locations and information associated with those locations and then sharing this data and allowing others to perform work against it. Potential applications include but are not limited to door to door sales rep teams, meter maids, event management, . The current version of Drops requires a network connection to push and pull data from an Azure Cosmos Database.

## Planned Updates

### Functionality

DB Transactions

Edit Pins - DropDetailViewPage

Edit Areas - AreaCreationViewPage(Can we use this page for editing existing areas in addition to the creation of new areas? probably)

---

User Feedback

upon incorrect credential entry, user text entry in entries will be cleared, placholders will be restored with feedback content in red coloring as opposed to original coloring

This functionality is for the login and registration pages, once we have the logic worked out for this process we can derivve similiar logic for the dropdetail view page and the areacreationviewpage
