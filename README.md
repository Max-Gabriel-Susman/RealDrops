# Drops

Drops is an application where users may create and share areas with oneanother, each area encapsulates the data needed to render and perform work on a collection of pins, these pins are map markers that open windows of information when tapped. An area is intended to allow users to capture sets of geolocations for the purposes of storing locations and information associated with those locations and then sharing this data and allowing others to perform work against it. Potential applications include but are not limited to door to door sales rep teams, meter maids, event management, . The current version of Drops requires a network connection to push and pull data from an Azure Cosmos Database.
