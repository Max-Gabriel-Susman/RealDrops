## !LoginPage Vector Graphics failing to Render on android!

## Description

RealDrops is an outdoor Sales Lead management application that allows users to represent potential leads and other entities with a pin(referred to as a drop) using their devices default maps API. Drops are persisted in collections that are members of area objects that have a pair of coordinates to center the map view upon rendering.
Areas also have a collection of 'Subscribers' these are users  who are allowed to access the area and manage it's drops, the subscribers include the owner(the creator of the area) and all the users he has shared this area with. Data is persisted by an Azure Cosmos DB backend, tandem local persistence is still in the works so the application currently requires a network connection.
